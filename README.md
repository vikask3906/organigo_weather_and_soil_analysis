# 🌾 Smart Crop Suitability & Weather Forecasting with LSTM

## 📌 Overview
Hey there! 👋 This project is all about **helping farmers and agricultural enthusiasts** make informed decisions based on **real-time weather forecasts** and **AI-powered temperature predictions**. By combining weather data with **crop suitability analysis**, we can determine the best times for sowing and harvesting different crops. 🌱☀️

## 🔍 What This Project Does
- 🌦️ **Fetches real-time weather data** using the Agro Monitoring API
- 🤖 **Uses an LSTM model** to predict future temperature trends
- 🌾 **Analyzes crop suitability** based on upcoming weather conditions
- 📊 **Visualizes predictions** with easy-to-understand graphs and tables

*A simple illustration of how weather forecasting & AI predictions work together!*

## 📜 Dependencies
Before you get started, make sure you have these installed:
```bash
pip install keras requests numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Steps to Get Started
### 1️⃣ Fetch Weather Data
- The script pulls **temperature, humidity, and rainfall** data from the **Agro Monitoring API** for a specific location.

### 2️⃣ Train an LSTM Model
- The model **learns from historical weather data** to predict **future temperature trends**.

### 3️⃣ Check Crop Suitability
- The program **compares forecasted weather** with **optimal crop conditions** to determine which crops can be sown or harvested in the upcoming days.

## 📊 What You’ll See
This project generates:
- **Time-series plots** showing actual vs. predicted temperatures
- **Crop suitability tables** based on upcoming weather conditions

## 📌 How to Use It
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-crop-lstm.git
cd weather-crop-lstm
```
2. Run the **Jupyter Notebook** or open it in **Google Colab**.
3. Set your **latitude** and **longitude** to match your location.
4. Train the model and **watch the predictions roll in!** 📈

### 🌱 Crop Suitability Table
| Crop   | Suitable to Sow | Suitable to Harvest |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Rice   | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No            |
| Wheat  | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes           |
